The icons on the right hand side of the font preview, indicate what weights are available for that typeface.<br/><br/><strong>R</strong> -- Regular,<br/><strong>B</strong> -- Bold,<br/><strong>I</strong> -- Italics,<br/><strong>BI</strong> -- Bold Italics<br/><br/>When decideing what font to use, ensure that the chosen font contains the font weight required by the element. For example, main headings are bold, so you need to select a new font for these elements which supports a bold font weight. If you select a font which does not have a bold icon, the font will not be applied. <br/><br/>Browse the online <a href='http://www.google.com/webfonts'>Google Font Library</a><br/><br/><b>Custom fonts</b> (Advanced Users):<br/> Other then those available from Google fonts, custom fonts may also be applied to the elements listed below. To do this an additional field is provided below the google fonts list. Here you may enter the details of a font family, size, line-height etc. for a custom font. This information is entered in the form of the shorthand 'font:' CSS declaration, for example:<br/><br/><b>bold italic small-caps 1em/1.5em arial,sans-serif</b><br/><br/>If a font is specified in this field then the font listed in the Google font drop menu above will not be applied to the element in question. If you wish to use the Google font specified in the drop down list and just specify a new font size or line height, you can do so in this field also, however the name of the Google font <b>MUST</b> also be entered into this field. You may need to visit the Google fonts web page to find the exact CSS name for the font you have chosen.",
